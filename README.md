# Overview and Exigence
Maps out work schedules for students of the Francis Tuttle Technology Center Cybersecurity and Network Defense program. Can be modified to fit similar course structures.

As of the conception of this program (2/16/2022), I am currently the interim/adjunct instructor of the Cybersecurity and Network Defense program at Francis Tuttle Technology Center. The program is self-paced and extremely flexible depending on our students' individual needs; however, this brings a lot of variance, unpredictability, and complications when I as an instructor have to make sure my students are getting their work done on time, and my students have to make sure that they are on top of their work so that they may graduate the program on time. In order to streamline the tedious process of setting up schedules for students, I took it upon myself to create and distribute this simple Python program throughout the classroom.

# Usage
1) Run the program in your environment of choice. If you don't have one set up and/or would prefer an online interpreter, https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler is a pretty good free option. Simply paste the code from cyberCalc.py into the IDE and run the code

At this point, you should be seeing this text in the output

2) From here, enter the last course you have **completely** finished. For our purposes, we can assume the role of a student who has just finished their Python course.

3) Now we will enter the amount of assignments we have completed in the next course (in our case, Network Security). I will assume 0% completion of the course.

4) Next, enter the course you want to have completed by the end of the allotted time. In our case, I will assume that I want to finish the Cyber Forensics Course so that I can graduate the program.

5) Finally, enter in the amount of school days you want to spend working on your selected amount of course material. Please refer to the Francis Tuttle Calendar located at https://www.francistuttle.edu/academic-calendar to properly adjust for breaks. As for me, I will assume that there are 66 more days left in the schoolyear and that I want to complete the program on the last day of school (not a good idea by the way, you should aim to finish at least a few days earlier).

6) Use the information returned by the program to fill out your Individual Learning Plans
